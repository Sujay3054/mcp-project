## 📖 Overview

> **MCP Projects** are modular Python tools for automating APIs and workflow integration.  
> Think of MCP as your command superpower: connect, control, and create—your way!

---


## ✨ Features

- **Plug-n-Play Integrations**: Instantly connect to APIs like Notion.
- **Interactive Commands**: User, database, and page management—right from the shell.
- **Safety First**: API calls are wrapped for error handling and reliability.
- **Extensible by Design**: Add your own MCP modules!

## 🧑‍💻 Extending MCP

Want to add a new integration?  
Just follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory for your module (e.g., `myapi/`).
2. Implement your Python tools following the examples in `notion/new.py`.
3. Register your commands with the MCP core.
4. Add documentation in a module-specific README.

> **Pro Tip:** Browse existing modules for patterns and best practices.
